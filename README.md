# Breadcrumb

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/khacluan/khacluan-breadcrumb.png)](https://travis-ci.org/khacluan/khacluan-breadcrumb)

Breadcrumb is small package for meteor to make a breadcrumb base on Iron Router


## Compatibility

accounts-entry is presently compatible with Iron Router 0.6.0 and above. Since meteorite doesn't support semantic version locking, we are currently pegged to 0.6.4 of Iron-router.

## Getting started

Run:

```
meteor add khacluan:breadcrumb
```

## Interested in building a quick meteor app that starts with Breadcrumb?

## Thank you
